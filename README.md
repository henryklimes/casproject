# Media Literacy Hub

A comprehensive educational website about digital misinformation, fake news, and AI-generated deepfakes. This project aims to educate students and the wider community about media literacy by providing accessible articles, visual explanations, and practical tools for critical evaluation of online information.

The rapid spread of digital misinformation, including fake news and AI-generated deepfakes, has made it increasingly difficult for students to distinguish between reliable and unreliable information online. This affects democratic decision-making, public trust, and individual judgment, making media literacy an essential modern skill.
